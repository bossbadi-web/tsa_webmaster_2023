    <p>There are many different ways to train for microgravity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is a plane called KC-135, which is one way they experience microgravity. They fly the plane all the way
        into the air and quickly nosedive, providing a microgravity environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a "Precision Air-Bearing Floor," which allows astronauts to experience moving heavy objects as if they
        are in space, where there is no friction present.
      </li>
      <li>
        To practice leaving the space shuttle to make repairs to the ship, astronauts go underwater. Since waterâ€™s
        gravitational level is lower than normal, it is a perfect place to practice. Furthermore, astronauts could
        practice in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory Pool, where they can insert panels simulating the outside of space.
